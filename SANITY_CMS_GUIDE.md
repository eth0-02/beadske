# üéØ Sanity CMS Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Setup Status

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ **Sanity Studio:** Deployed at https://beads.sanity.studio
- ‚úÖ **Website:** Deployed at https://ubiquitous-begonia-1bc64e.netlify.app
- ‚úÖ **Connection:** Sanity API is connected and working
- ‚úÖ **Project ID:** wrmf59p3
- ‚úÖ **Dataset:** production

### The Issue:
Your website is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** that fetches data from Sanity when the page loads in the browser. When you publish changes in Sanity, the website doesn't automatically rebuild - it just fetches fresh data on the next page load.

However, **browser caching** and **Netlify CDN caching** can prevent you from seeing changes immediately.

## üîß How to See Changes After Publishing in Sanity

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Quickest)
After publishing in Sanity:
1. Go to your website
2. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Changes should appear

### Option 2: Clear Cache and Redeploy (Most Reliable)
1. Go to **Netlify Dashboard** ‚Üí **Deploys**
2. Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Clear cache and deploy site**
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for build to complete
4. Refresh your website

### Option 3: Set Up Automatic Webhook (Best Long-term Solution)

#### Step 1: Create Netlify Build Hook
1. **Netlify** ‚Üí Your site ‚Üí **Site configuration** ‚Üí **Build & deploy**
2. Scroll to **Build hooks** ‚Üí **Add build hook**
3. Name: `Sanity Content Update`
4. Branch: `main`
5. **Copy the webhook URL**

#### Step 2: Add Webhook to Sanity
1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/manage
2. Select project **wrmf59p3**
3. **API** ‚Üí **Webhooks** ‚Üí **Create webhook**
4. Fill in:
   - Name: `Netlify Auto Deploy`
   - URL: (paste Netlify build hook URL)
   - Dataset: `production`
   - Trigger on: `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`
5. **Save**

Now when you publish in Sanity, Netlify will automatically rebuild in 2-3 minutes!

## üß™ Test the Connection

### Test 1: Check if Sanity API is responding
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
fetch('https://wrmf59p3.api.sanity.io/v2024-01-01/data/query/production?query=*[_type=="product"][0]{title,price}')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log(d))
```

You should see a product with its title and price.

### Test 2: Verify Environment Variables
Check Netlify has these variables:
- `VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=wrmf59p3`
- `VITE_SANITY_DATASET=production`
- `VITE_SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-01-01`
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...`
- `VITE_PAYMENT_SERVER_URL=https://maasai-payment-server-production.up.railway.app`

## üöÄ Quick Troubleshooting

### Changes not appearing?
1. ‚úÖ Did you click **PUBLISH** (not just save)?
2. ‚úÖ Did you hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)?
3. ‚úÖ Try clearing browser cache completely
4. ‚úÖ Try in incognito/private window
5. ‚úÖ Trigger a new deploy in Netlify with cache clear

### Product not showing on website?
1. ‚úÖ Check it's **PUBLISHED** (not draft)
2. ‚úÖ Check it has all required fields (title, slug, price, images)
3. ‚úÖ Check the slug is unique
4. ‚úÖ Hard refresh the website

### Images not loading?
1. ‚úÖ Make sure images are uploaded in Sanity
2. ‚úÖ Check image URLs in browser console
3. ‚úÖ Verify Sanity project ID is correct in environment variables

## üìä Summary

**Your setup is working correctly!** The "issue" is just how SPAs work:
- Data is fetched when the page loads
- Browser/CDN caching can delay seeing changes
- Solution: Hard refresh or set up webhook for automatic rebuilds

**No need to redeploy Sanity Studio** - it's already live and working at https://beads.sanity.studio

**Everything is connected properly** - just remember to:
1. **PUBLISH** (not draft)
2. **Hard refresh** to see changes
3. Or set up webhook for automatic updates
