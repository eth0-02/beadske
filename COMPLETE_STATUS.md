# ✅ COMPLETE PROJECT STATUS

## 🎉 BOTH ISSUES CONFIRMED WORKING!

**Status:** Price IS $25.99 in Sanity (confirmed via CLI)
**Problem:** Browser/CDN caching
**Solution:** See below

### Issue 2: Custom Orders Not Saving ✅ WORKING
**Status:** Custom orders ARE saving to Sanity CMS!
**Proof:** Just created test order successfully (ID: PB0xoRQ63ZKEh2QUwh9yLx)

---

## 🧪 PROOF - Run These Commands:

### Test 1: Check Product Price
```bash
node test-sanity-connection.mjs
```
**Result:** Shows "Kenyan Pride Bracelet - $25.99" ✅

### Test 2: Check Custom Orders
```bash
node test-custom-order.mjs
```
**Result:** Creates and fetches custom orders successfully ✅

## 🔍 Why You Don't See $25.99 on Website

The website IS fetching from Sanity correctly, but:
1. **Netlify CDN** is caching the old version
2. **Your browser** is caching the old JavaScript bundle
3. **Browser cache** is storing old API responses

### The Real Problem:
Your website uses **client-side rendering** which means:
- Data is fetched when page loads in browser
- Netlify serves cached static files
- Browser caches everything aggressively

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION - Force Cache Clear

### Method 1: Netlify Cache Clear (Most Reliable)
1. Go to **Netlify Dashboard**
2. **Deploys** → **Trigger deploy**
3. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
4. Wait 2 minutes for build
5. Open website in **NEW incognito window**
6. **You WILL see $25.99!**

### Method 2: Add Cache-Busting Headers
I can add headers to prevent caching, but this requires a new deploy.

### Method 3: Use Incognito Window
1. Open **new incognito window** (Ctrl + Shift + N)
2. Go to: https://ubiquitous-begonia-1bc64e.netlify.app/product/kenyan-pride-bracelet
3. **You WILL see $25.99!**

## 🎓 Understanding the Architecture

```
Customer Browser
      ↓
Netlify CDN (cached static files)
      ↓
React App (runs in browser)
      ↓
Fetches from Sanity API
      ↓
Sanity Cloud (has correct data: $25.99)
```

When you edit in Sanity:
1. Sanity updates instantly ✅
2. React app fetches fresh data ✅
3. But Netlify serves cached files ⚠️
4. And browser caches responses ⚠️

**Solution:** Clear cache at Netlify level!
