# üö® SANITY CORS ISSUE - IMMEDIATE FIX

## ‚ùå Problem Identified:
The API request is failing even though all environment variables are correct. This is a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** issue in your Sanity project settings.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Add Netlify Domain to Sanity CORS

### Step 1: Go to Sanity Management Console
1. Open: https://www.sanity.io/manage
2. Select project: **wrmf59p3**

### Step 2: Add CORS Origin
1. Click **API** tab
2. Scroll to **CORS Origins** section
3. Click **"Add CORS origin"**
4. Add these origins:

```
https://ubiquitous-begonia-1bc64e.netlify.app
```

AND

```
https://*.netlify.app
```

5. **Check "Allow credentials"** for both
6. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test Immediately
Go back to: `https://ubiquitous-begonia-1bc64e.netlify.app/test-sanity`

Click **"üîÑ Refresh Data"**

**You'll see all 20 products!**

## üîç Why This Happened:

Sanity blocks requests from domains that aren't in the CORS whitelist. Your Netlify domain wasn't added yet, so all API requests are being blocked.

---

## üìã Complete CORS Origins List:

Add ALL of these to Sanity CORS:

1. `http://localhost:3000` (for local development)
2. `http://localhost:3001` (for local development)
3. `http://localhost:4173` (for Vite preview)
4. `https://ubiquitous-begonia-1bc64e.netlify.app` (your site)
5. `https://*.netlify.app` (all Netlify preview deploys)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time to Fix: 1 minute
