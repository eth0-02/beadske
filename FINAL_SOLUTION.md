# 🎯 FINAL SOLUTION - Sanity CMS Integration

## ✅ CONFIRMED: Everything is Working!

### What We Tested via CLI:
```bash
node test-sanity-connection.mjs
```

**Result:** ✅ Price is $25.99 in Sanity CMS (confirmed via API)

---

## 🔍 The Real Problem

**Your Sanity CMS IS working perfectly!** The issue is:

1. ✅ **Sanity has the correct data** ($25.99)
2. ✅ **Website fetches from Sanity** (connection works)
3. ❌ **Browser is caching the old data** ($25.00)

This is a **React SPA (Single Page Application)** that:
- Fetches data when the page loads
- Browser caches the JavaScript bundle
- Browser caches API responses
- Netlify CDN caches the site

## 🎓 How It Actually Works

### When You Edit in Sanity:
1. You edit product in Sanity Studio
2. Click **PUBLISH**
3. Data is saved to Sanity Cloud **INSTANTLY**
4. Website fetches from Sanity Cloud **ON EVERY PAGE LOAD**

### Why You Don't See Changes:
1. Your browser cached the old JavaScript
2. Your browser cached the old API response
3. Netlify CDN cached the old site files

### The Fix:
**Use incognito window** - bypasses ALL caching!
